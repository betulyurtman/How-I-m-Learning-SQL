First of all, I started with a Udemy course. 

SQL - MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence:
https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-mysql-for-data-analytics-and-business-intelligence/ 

I have completed more than half of this course, and I can say that it is a really detailed course on SQL with exercises.

Also, I watched a Youtube video on SQL Tutorial.

SQL Tutorial - Full Database Course for Beginners:

I think https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp this channel is a great choice to start learning something new. 

Lastly, for now, I did some practice on HackerRank.

After I complete the Udemy course, I will continue to practice on HackerRank.
